# LibJpeg.Net

A fork of the [LibJpeg.Net C# port by BitMiracle](http://bitmiracle.com/libjpeg/), with added Subsampling support at the JpegImage API level, rather than solely in the Classic/low-level API.

Slimmed to just the portion emitting the DLL and run unit tests, rather than the larger version with multiple additional command-line executables. Upgraded to VS2013 and NuGet Package Restore.
